1. COMPILING

The code has been developed in Java. It can be compiled with:

javac Circuit.java

2. EXECUTING

The program is executed by running:

java Circuit <progname>

Where <progname> is one of the following program names:

- 6multiplexer
- 11multiplexer
- 16middle3

For example, to run the 11-multiplexer genetic program:

java Circuit 11multiplexer

The program will then run the 11-multiplexer using the appropriate parameters tuned for that
specific program.

NOTE: When running the 16middle3 program, the JVM heap space will get exhausted after a
relatively short time. To avoid this, you should increase the JVM maximum heap space and execute
16-middle-3 using the following command:

java -Xmx1g Circuit 16middle3

This will increase the heap to 1GB which should be available on most modern systems.
